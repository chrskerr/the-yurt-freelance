#### What We Did:
We built a basic landing page for Michael Hobbs' Chiropractic clinic to help him launch his own practise. 
Our focuses were ensuring the site was easy for his clients to navigate and find key information, as well as book appointments with Michael at his clinic.

#### How We Did It:
A straight-forward website using HTML, CSS, JS and some jQuery for animations, hosted on GitHub and accelerated through the CloudFlare CDN.
